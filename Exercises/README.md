### Testing your code (Python)

* Fill in the functions in `template.py`.
* Run: `python testingFramework.py template.py`.
* Review the output to verify which tests have been passed and which have been failed.


## How to start (JavaScript)

Inside the `js` folder, you can find a number of files:

* `template.js`. This file provides the functions' prototypes for the exercises of the assessment. You need to complete the code inside of each of the functions, following the instructions given in the exercises. Make sure that the type of variable returned is correct.
* `test_solution.js`. This file contains the test cases that you can use to verify if your code works as intended. Feel free to add your own test cases to further test your code. However, no instructions are provided on how to do so.
* `package.json`. This file contains details of the libraries needed to install the testing framework and the scripts to test your code. 

### Testing your code (JavaScript)

* To test your JavaScript code, you need to have `node` installed.
* Run `npm install` from the project folder (the current folder) to install the testing libraries.
* Execute `npm --solutionfile=NAMEOFYOURSOLUTIONFILE run test-js` to run all the JS tests. So, if your solutions are in a file `template.js` you should run `npm --solutionfile=template run test-js` to test your code.
* Review the output to verify which tests have been passed and which have been failed.
